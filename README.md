## Requirements:
  * This style is based on Monaco font (https://github.com/todylu/monaco.ttf).
  * Notepad++, of course.

## Installation:
Copy the Material-Dark.xml file to "%APPDATA%\Notepad++\themes" and in a portable installation to "%Notepad++%\themes".

Or simply import it to Notepad++ by going to Menu -> Settings -> Import -> Import Style theme(s) option.

## Important note:
Simply downloading the xml file only from GitHub doesn't work, because the file downloaded this way is not a valid xml.
You have to:
  * download the whole project
  * extract the xml file and copy it in C:\Users<YourUser>AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\themes\
  * restart Notepad and enable the theme
