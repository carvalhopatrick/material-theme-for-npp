# Material Theme (Dark) for Notepad++
Forked to match my color preferences. Credits to [naderi](https://github.com/naderi/material-theme-for-npp)

Added a modified `markdown._preinstalled.udl.xml` to support markdown files. Replace the default Notepad++ file with this for markdown to look good with the theme.
